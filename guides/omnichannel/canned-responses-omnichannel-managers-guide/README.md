{% hint style="info" %}
Canned responses allow you to save message snippets that you can call with shortcuts (preceded with `!`) to communicate a quick note to your visitors in Omnichannel and for messaging in regular conversations inside your Rocket.Chat's workspace.
{% endhint %}

If you are using canned responses for the first time, please check the Rocket.Chat Admin's guide for canned responses or contact your workspace Administrator to enable canned responses on your workspace.
