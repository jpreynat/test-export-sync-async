# Omnichannel

If you struggle to handle leads and clients in a multi-channel environment, you lose valuable potential sales. That's where Omnichannel comes into the picture. Omnichannel is a communication strategy essential to **acquire** and **retain** customers. It is designed to create an exceptional customer experience across the companyâ€™s brands, building a better relationship with its audience. It gives consumers a choice to engage with you on their favorite channels:

* SMS
* Email
* Voice
* WhatsApp
* WeChat
* Telegram
* Facebook Messenger
* Live Chat, and so on.
