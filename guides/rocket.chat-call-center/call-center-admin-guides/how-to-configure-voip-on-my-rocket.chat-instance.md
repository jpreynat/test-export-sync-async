## 2. Configuration of the management server (Asterisk)

**Rocket.Chat** is using \*\*\*\* [**Asterisk**](https://www.asterisk.org) as its call management server. To get your own Asterisk server please [contact](https://www.asterisk.org/products/) Asterisk.

Rocket.Chat needs the following credentials to connect to Asterisk and start receiving the call management matrix such as queues, extensions, and other management data.

{% hint style="info" %}
Asterisk is a software PBX (A switching system for organizations to share trunks).

Rocket.Chat is using it for call bookkeeping data like how many queues are there, extension data, agents allocated to a queue, routing system, and others.
{% endhint %}

To configure this integration between Rocket.Chat and Asterisk:

* Go to **Avatar Menu > Administration > Settings**
* Search **Call Center**
* Under the **Settings** tab navigate to **Management Server** and click it open.
* All the settings needed here should be provided to you by your _Asterisk manager._

## 3. Configuration of call server

Rocket.Chat needs a WebSocket connection for the forwarding of calls from Asterisk to Rocket.Chat.

To configure this WebSocket connection between Rocket.Chat and Asterisk:

* Go to **Avatar Menu > Administration > Settings**
* Search **Call Center**
* Under the **Settings** tab navigate to **Server Configuration** and click it open.
* All the settings needed here should be provided to you by your _Asterisk manager._
