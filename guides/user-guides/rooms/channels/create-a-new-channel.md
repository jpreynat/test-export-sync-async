# Create a new Channel

To create a new channel:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (383).png>)

You can set the name of that channel, choose if the channel is public or private, set the channel to read-only, broadcast the channel, and invite users.

In read-only channels, messages can only be sent by users with write permissions. All users can react to messages in this channel. Read-only channels are most suitable for announcements and voting.

Encrypted channels, messages will be end-to-end encrypted. See: [End to End Encryption](../../security-bundle/end-to-end-encryption.md) for details.

Broadcasted channels behave like read-only channels, with only users with the right permission being able to post there. The differences to a read-only channel are:

* Users without permission (the same one to post on read-only channels) inside this channel won't be able to see each other in the user list.
* Users without permission won't be able to react to messages.
* Every message contains a reply button that redirects the user to a direct message with the user that posted the message.
* This channel cannot be converted to a read-only or open channel again.
