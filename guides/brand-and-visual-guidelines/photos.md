# Photos

We increasingly want to appropriate a unique, contemporary language that conveys our value proposition in the stories that we are telling. So, we have some guidelines to inspire the way the Rocket.Chat style must be.

### Treatment

Our photos are high temperature and saturated, resulting in a simple, proprietary effect.

### Image Bank

First of all, when choosing a bank image photo, it is necessary to understand the content and context that it will bring to your art. Then you will do the right search and filter the best image. The more specific your search term is, the easier it will be to find the right image.
