# Payment Methods

You can add multiple credit cards here.

Add a new credit card, as shown below:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (95).png>)

Delete a card, as shown below:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (96).png>)

Set a card as your default payment method.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (97).png>)

If you have only one credit card added, it is impossible for you to delete the only payment method on your own. Please contact [support@rocket.chat](mailto:support@rocket.chat) to get it deleted.
