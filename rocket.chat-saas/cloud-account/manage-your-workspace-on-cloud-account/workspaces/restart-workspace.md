# Restart Workspace

A restart of the server is recommended when facing small performance issues, e.g., messages are slow, messages are greyed-out.

To restart your workspace:

After you restart your workspace, it will take 1-5 minutes (depending upon your number of users) for the workspace to be restarted.
